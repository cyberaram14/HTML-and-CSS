		<h1>"Believe Me Natalie"</h1>
		<p>Believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie</p>
		<p>This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now</p>
		<p>Please believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie</p>
		<p>This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now</p>
		<p>Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the "Oh, no"s out</p>
		<p>And believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie</p>
		<p>This is your last chance</p>
		
		<h2>--VERSE 1--</h2>
		<p>There is an old cliche under your Money baby</p>
		<p>Remember we used to make out underneath that couch</p>
		<p>Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the "Oh, no"s out</p>
		<p>Yes, there is an old cliche under your Monet, baby</p>
		
		<h2>--BRIDGE--</h2>
		<p>You left the station now to the floor with speculation</p>
		<p>What was it for?</p>
		<p>In that old hallway, Mom says, "Why don't you stay?</p>
		<p>You've been away for a long time"</p>
		
		<h2>--CHORUS--</h2>
		<p>Believe me, Natalie</p>
		<p>This is your last chance to find a go-go</p>
		<p>Forget what they said in SoHo</p>
		<p>And walk away</p>
		<p>If my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day</p>
		<p>It's alright by me</p>
		
		<h2>--OUTRO--</h2>
		<p>God, help me somehow</p>
		<p>There's no time for survival left</p>
		<p>The time is now</p>
		<p>'Cause this might be your last chance to disco</p>
		<p>oh-oh oh-oh</p>
